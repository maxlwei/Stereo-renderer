Compiling and Running on *nix
=============================

The provided Makefile will compile this assignment on a number of Linux/Unix
base systems. All you need to do is run:

    make

To run the executable:

    ./raytracer

By default, this will render a scene with only a red cube and save the 
resulting image as output.bmp.

To run the executable and render a different scene, pass it as the first
argument:

    ./raytracer your_scene_file_path



File Description
=================================

The "main.cpp" is the entry of the program, it uses Parser (defined in "parser.hpp" and "parser.cpp")
to parse the scene file and create a Scene object (defined in "scene.hpp") for the ray tracing step.

Then Raytracer (defined in "raytracer.hpp" and "raytracer.cpp") is used to render the scene. It renders
the scene on an Image object and output the image as a bmp file (which is supported by "image.hpp").

The scene object may contain several Gemeotric Objects (defined in "object.hpp" and "object.cpp"). The
basic math toolkit such as Vector, Matrix, Ray, and Intersection are defined in "basic.hpp".


Scene Format
============

See scenes/basic.ray for a self-describing scene file.
